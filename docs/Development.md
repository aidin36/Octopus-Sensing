Development Guide

Installing from source
======================

you need `poetry`:

```
pip3 install poetry
```

(Refer to [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](Poetry installation guide) for alternative ways of installing Poetry.)

Then `cd` to where the source code located and run:

```
poetry install
poetry build
```

It will create a virtual environment and installs `octopus-sensing` with its dependencies in it.
